# gdb-List

The small program is an enhancement to the gdb list command. It follows the same syntax as lsit, but also indicates the breakpoints and the next statement to be executed.
Python needs to be included when compiling gdb.

To use it:

1) Copy the program to ~/.gdbscripts
2) Add the line to ~/.gdbinit:
   source ~/.gdbscripts/List.py

Usage:

List

or

L
